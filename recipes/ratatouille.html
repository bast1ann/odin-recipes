        <p class="text">Again, this recipe is not of my invention, I got it from <a href="https://www.howtocook.recipes/homemade-ratatouille-recipe/" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a>.</p>
        <p class="text">And again, I have never eaten this dish, but I want so much to do it and eat it, it just looks delicious. And yes, if you were wondering I discovered this
        dish watching the Disney Movie Ratatouille.</p>

        <p class="section-title">Ingredients</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Eggplant</strong> - Just one adds a nice purple color to a traditional ratatouille recipe.</li>
          <li><strong>Zucchini</strong> - Take 2 of these and slice them up to add more color.</li>
          <li><strong>Roma tomatoes</strong> - Slice these up to add red to the arrangement.</li>
          <li><strong>Crushed tomatoes</strong> - Now these are for that sublime sauce!</li>
          <li><strong>Carrot</strong> - Shredded, it goes into the sauce.</li>
          <li><strong>Garlic cloves and onion</strong> - You need these to add some flavor and pungent tastes to your sauce</li>
          <li><strong>Dried herbs</strong> - You'll need basil and parsley to bring out the natural flavors of the veggies</li>
          <li><strong>Olive oil</strong> - A signature fat needed to sauté the onions and garlic.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="section-title">Steps</p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Preheat the oven and meanwhile cook the onion, garlic and carrot until it's tender on the stove top.</li>
          <li>Add the crushed tomatoes and seasonings and simmer for about 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Taste at this point to see if the seasoning is balanced, and once the sauce is thick, pour it into your baking dish.</li>
          <li>Now you'll arrange the slices of vegetables in a pretty circular pattern and brush with olive oil. Cover it and bake until done!</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="section-title">Extra tips and tricks</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Use the freshest produce.</strong> Don't take those tomatoes that look like you’d better use them up. The success of ratatouille depends on the freshness of your vegetables. Take the time to choose fresh vegetables and your vegetable ratatouille will taste vibrant and delicious!</li>
          <li><strong>Slice all the vegetables as uniformly as you can.</strong> This will ensure they cook evenly.</li>
          <li><strong>Cover the dish.</strong> You don't want the top burning while it takes its time in the oven!</li>
          <li><strong>Get bread.</strong> You won't regret having slices of bread to dunk in this amazing sauce!</li>
        </ul>
