        <p class="text">In this recipe I will show you the way I was taught by my mother to do spaghetti with tomato sauce and sauteed mushrooms.</p>
        <p class="text">The recipe will be separated in 2 main parts: 1. how to do the tomato sauce 2. how to do the mushrooms. The spaghetti used will be the one you can buy
        in any store, so just follow the instructions in the package to do them.</p>
        <p class="text">This dish is for 3 portions, and if you want to do more portions, just consider 2 tomatoes by each new portion.</p>

        <p class="subsection-title"><em>Tomato Sauce</em></p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Put the tomatoes in a cooking pot with water, let it boil and take out the tomatoes when you see they are peeling.
          Put them aside and let them cool. When it's cool enough peel the tomatoes and grind them.</li>
          <li>Chop the onion and peppers in little pieces.</li>
          <li>Grate the garlic.</li>
          <li>Now in a cooking pot put 1 tablespoon of olive oil and then the garlic and chopped onion. Let them 1-2 minute and then add the chopped pepper, let them 1 minute more
          and finally add the tomato pur√©e.</li>
          <li>Now add 1 tablespoon of sugar, this is to reduce the acid flavour of the tomatoes.</li>
          <li>Add the dried oregano and salt to your like and let it cook by 20-25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="subsection-title"><em>Sauteed Mushrooms</em></p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Cut to slices your mushrooms.</li>
          <li>In a frying pan add a little bit of butter and olive oil.</li>
          <li>Now add your sliced mushrooms and let them cook, I let them cook 5 minutes approximately but you can take them out to your liking.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="text"><em>Now you just have to combine your spaghetti, tomato sauce and sauteed mushrooms and the dish is ready!
        You can add a little bit of parmesane cheese if you like it.</em></p>
